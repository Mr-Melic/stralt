ACTION_ID: AUX-GAMEKEY-NO-CONFIRM  
SOURCE_AUTOMATION: Admin UX & Information Architecture Auditor  
TITLE: Confirm GameKey approve, reject, and mark emailed  
CATEGORY: destructive-actions  
PRIORITY: P0  
CONFIDENCE: HIGH  
EVIDENCE: After PR #258, Purchases Approve called `adminApproveGameKeyPurchase` (mints a 120-char key, records Doka on the request) in one click. Reject is irreversible. Mark emailed wipes the plaintext reveal. Shop Grant already confirmed. Fixed: `PurchaseConfirm` in `AdminGameKeyPurchases.tsx`; copy in `gameKeyApproveConfirmBody` does not claim wallet mint.  
SYSTEMS_AFFECTED: AdminGameKeyPurchases; dokaGameKey  
RECOMMENDED_ACTION: Keep confirms. Cancel must not call the actor.  
AUTONOMY: SAFE_TO_AUTO_IMPLEMENT  
DEPENDENCIES: None  
REGRESSION_RISK: LOW  
VALIDATION_REQUIRED: Approve/Reject/Mark emailed open a dialog; Cancel does not mutate; Approve still reveals the code.  
STATUS: AUTO_FIXED

ACTION_ID: AUX-UNBAN-COPY-STALE  
SOURCE_AUTOMATION: Admin UX & Information Architecture Auditor  
TITLE: Unban dialog claimed achievement progress was cleared  
CATEGORY: terminology  
PRIORITY: P1  
CONFIDENCE: HIGH  
EVIDENCE: Ban confirm (Shop) and `adminBanAccount` keep claimed flags (`shouldWipeAchievementsOnBan` is false). Unban body said “Cleared achievement progress is not restored.” Operators could think ban wiped feats. Fixed: unban body says progress was kept on ban.  
SYSTEMS_AFFECTED: AdminDashboard Shop tab  
RECOMMENDED_ACTION: Keep copy aligned with ban-keeps-claimed-flags. Do not reintroduce wipe-on-ban.  
AUTONOMY: SAFE_TO_AUTO_IMPLEMENT  
DEPENDENCIES: AUX-UNBAN-NO-CONFIRM  
REGRESSION_RISK: LOW  
VALIDATION_REQUIRED: Ban and Unban dialogs agree that claimed rewards stay claimed.  
STATUS: AUTO_FIXED  

---

ACTION_ID: AUX-UNBAN-NO-ASSERT  
SOURCE_AUTOMATION: Admin UX & Information Architecture Auditor  
TITLE: Unban toasted success without asserting #ok  
CATEGORY: save-feedback  
PRIORITY: P1  
CONFIDENCE: HIGH  
EVIDENCE: Ban used `assertAdminCmdOk`. Unban awaited `adminUnbanAccount` and toasted success even if the result was `#err`. Fixed: same assert as ban.  
SYSTEMS_AFFECTED: AdminDashboard Shop tab  
RECOMMENDED_ACTION: Keep assert. Do not treat `{ __kind__: "err" }` as success.  
AUTONOMY: SAFE_TO_AUTO_IMPLEMENT  
DEPENDENCIES: None  
REGRESSION_RISK: LOW  
VALIDATION_REQUIRED: Unauthorized unban shows an error toast, not Unbanned.  
STATUS: AUTO_FIXED  

---

ACTION_ID: AUX-NO-BANNED-LIST  
SOURCE_AUTOMATION: Admin UX & Information Architecture Auditor  
TITLE: Shop could ban without listing who is banned  
CATEGORY: list-ux  
PRIORITY: P1  
CONFIDENCE: HIGH  
EVIDENCE: `getBannedPrincipals` exists (`main.mo`, bindgen, mock). Shop had grant/ban fields only. Unban required remembering the principal. Fixed: read-only list on Shop; click fills the ban/unban field. Empty = valid default.  
SYSTEMS_AFFECTED: Shop tab; adminContract `readPrincipalListResult`  
RECOMMENDED_ACTION: Keep the list read-only. Do not add bulk unban without confirm.  
AUTONOMY: SAFE_TO_AUTO_IMPLEMENT  
DEPENDENCIES: None  
REGRESSION_RISK: LOW  
VALIDATION_REQUIRED: Ban then refresh shows the principal; click fills the field; Unban still confirms.  
STATUS: AUTO_FIXED

ACTION_ID: AUX-LEVELUP-PARTIAL  
SOURCE_AUTOMATION: Admin UX & Information Architecture Auditor  
TITLE: Level-up UI silently writes hardcoded remaining fields  
CATEGORY: system-config  
PRIORITY: P1  
CONFIDENCE: HIGH  
EVIDENCE: Drift audit 2026-09-01 surfaced all nine fields and `toBackendLevelUpConfig`. This run: disclosure no longer says “range and fail chance only” / hidden literals. Save still publishes live.  
SYSTEMS_AFFECTED: LevelUpConfigPanel  
RECOMMENDED_ACTION: Keep all nine fields visible. Do not reintroduce hardcoded clobber.  
AUTONOMY: SAFE_TO_AUTO_IMPLEMENT (disclosure); HUMAN for staged draft  
DEPENDENCIES: AUX-LIFE-NO-STATES  
REGRESSION_RISK: LOW for copy  
VALIDATION_REQUIRED: All nine inputs persist via `adminSetLevelUpConfig`.  
STATUS: AUTO_FIXED  

---

ACTION_ID: AUX-ENEMY-STATS-INCOMPLETE  
SOURCE_AUTOMATION: Admin UX & Information Architecture Auditor  
TITLE: Admin EnemyConfig is a spawn template, not combat identity  
CATEGORY: terminology  
PRIORITY: P1  
CONFIDENCE: HIGH  
EVIDENCE: Form is hp/ap/mp/init/level/regions/sprite. Runtime combat templates also have damage/res/sp/sr/chc. This run: editor heading is “Spawn template” plus a note that combat identity is not persisted here.  
SYSTEMS_AFFECTED: EnemyEditor  
RECOMMENDED_ACTION: Keep spawn-template copy. Do not add combat fields without a typed persist path.  
AUTONOMY: SAFE_TO_AUTO_IMPLEMENT (copy); HUMAN for persist  
DEPENDENCIES: None  
REGRESSION_RISK: HIGH if a third type is invented.  
VALIDATION_REQUIRED: Copy only until persist exists.  
STATUS: PARTIAL  

---

ACTION_ID: AUX-LIST-NO-FILTER-SORT  
SOURCE_AUTOMATION: Admin UX & Information Architecture Auditor  
TITLE: Lists need sort and structured filters  
CATEGORY: list-ux  
PRIORITY: P2  
CONFIDENCE: HIGH  
EVIDENCE: Search now on enemies, regions, spells, sprites, modifiers, achievements, names, bosses. Purchases already had query + status. No sort by level/name; no region/effect/active facets.  
SYSTEMS_AFFECTED: Entity lists  
RECOMMENDED_ACTION: Sort + facet filters. Do not paginate until counts exceed ~100.  
AUTONOMY: SAFE_TO_AUTO_IMPLEMENT (search shipped); HUMAN for sort/facets  
DEPENDENCIES: None  
REGRESSION_RISK: LOW  
VALIDATION_REQUIRED: Filter does not hide Add.  
STATUS: PARTIAL  

---

ACTION_ID: AUX-SHOP-PACKAGES-MISSING  
SOURCE_AUTOMATION: Admin UX & Information Architecture Auditor  
TITLE: Shop packages API unused by the Shop tab  
CATEGORY: economy  
PRIORITY: P1  
CONFIDENCE: HIGH  
EVIDENCE: Player path is GameKey/Mollie (PR #258). Shop copy: packages retired. `getShopPackages` / `adminSetShopPackage` remain on the actor. Do not add a package editor that would fight GameKey.  
SYSTEMS_AFFECTED: Shop tab; useShopQueries  
RECOMMENDED_ACTION: Leave packages unused until a product decision. Prefer GameKey Purchases.  
AUTONOMY: REPORT_ONLY  
DEPENDENCIES: None  
REGRESSION_RISK: HIGH if a second store ships  
VALIDATION_REQUIRED: N/A  
STATUS: SUPERSEDED  

---

ACTION_ID: AUX-PII-PURCHASES  
SOURCE_AUTOMATION: Admin UX & Information Architecture Auditor  
TITLE: Purchases need query, status filter, and proof confirm  
CATEGORY: pii / list-ux  
PRIORITY: P1  
CONFIDENCE: HIGH  
EVIDENCE: Proof/address table is gone. GameKey table still shows email + principal with search/status. Proof confirm N/A. Approve/reject/emailed confirms added (AUX-GAMEKEY-NO-CONFIRM). Redact still missing.  
SYSTEMS_AFFECTED: Purchases tab  
RECOMMENDED_ACTION: HUMAN — optional column redact for screenshare. Keep confirms.  
AUTONOMY: HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED (redact)  
DEPENDENCIES: None  
REGRESSION_RISK: LOW  
VALIDATION_REQUIRED: Filter narrows rows.  
STATUS: PARTIAL  

---

ACTION_ID: AUX-DIRTY-UNUSED  
SOURCE_AUTOMATION: Admin UX & Information Architecture Auditor  
TITLE: Field-level dirty + beforeunload still missing  
CATEGORY: unsaved-changes  
PRIORITY: P1  
CONFIDENCE: HIGH  
EVIDENCE: `AdminDashboardState.isDirty` is still hardcoded `false`. Leave-editor covers listed editors including sprites. Closing the browser tab has no `beforeunload`.  
SYSTEMS_AFFECTED: `gameTypes.ts` `isDirty`; all editors  
RECOMMENDED_ACTION: Set `isDirty` from form diffs; warn only when dirty; `beforeunload` when dirty.  
AUTONOMY: HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED  
DEPENDENCIES: AUX-SPRITE-LEAVE-UNWARNED  
REGRESSION_RISK: MEDIUM — false positives will train operators to dismiss.  
VALIDATION_REQUIRED: Unchanged form can leave without dialog; dirty form warns; refresh prompts.  
STATUS: PARTIAL  

---

ACTION_ID: AUX-BOSS-LOCALSTORAGE-AS-LIVE  
SOURCE_AUTOMATION: Admin UX & Information Architecture Auditor  
TITLE: Boss Save is a browser draft; Motoko writer unused  
CATEGORY: content-lifecycle  
PRIORITY: P0  
CONFIDENCE: HIGH  
EVIDENCE: `useBossQueries.ts` still reads/writes `pbv_boss_configs`. Canister types still diverge (`iconEmoji`/`loreText`/`chc` vs `defeated`/`adminNotes`). Draft wording and “Save browser draft” remain.  
SYSTEMS_AFFECTED: useBossQueries; BossesTab; `src/backend` BossConfig  
RECOMMENDED_ACTION: Align types, then staged draft → preview → activate. Show DRAFT vs ACTIVE badge.  
AUTONOMY: HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED  
DEPENDENCIES: AUX-LIFE-NO-STATES  
REGRESSION_RISK: HIGH — live actor reject if fields diverge.  
VALIDATION_REQUIRED: Save round-trips canister; another browser sees the same kit.  
STATUS: PARTIAL  

---

ACTION_ID: AUX-LIFE-NO-STATES  
SOURCE_AUTOMATION: Admin UX & Information Architecture Auditor  
TITLE: No DRAFT / VALIDATION FAILED / READY / ACTIVE / INACTIVE / LEGACY  
CATEGORY: content-lifecycle  
PRIORITY: P0  
CONFIDENCE: HIGH  
EVIDENCE: Achievement `active` and modifier `active` are the only lifecycle bits. Every other canister Save publishes live. Boss Save is a local draft next to live entity Saves.  
SYSTEMS_AFFECTED: All admin writers  
RECOMMENDED_ACTION: Introduce explicit states. Never render a saved draft as live. Preview-before-activate.  
AUTONOMY: HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED  
DEPENDENCIES: AUX-BOSS-LOCALSTORAGE-AS-LIVE  
REGRESSION_RISK: HIGH  
VALIDATION_REQUIRED: Draft save does not change player encounter tables.  
STATUS: NEW  

---

ACTION_ID: AUX-NAV-FLAT-15  
SOURCE_AUTOMATION: Admin UX & Information Architecture Auditor  
TITLE: Fifteen peer tabs, no groups, no command palette  
CATEGORY: navigation  
PRIORITY: P1  
CONFIDENCE: HIGH  
EVIDENCE: Flat `TABS` array. Sidebar scrolls. No Content / World / Economy / Health groups. Default tab is Enemies, not Overview.  
SYSTEMS_AFFECTED: AdminDashboard sidebar  
RECOMMENDED_ACTION: Grouped IA per audit proposal. Do not add empty domain tabs.  
AUTONOMY: HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED  
DEPENDENCIES: AUX-NAV-NO-OVERVIEW; AUX-NO-GLOBAL-SEARCH  
REGRESSION_RISK: MEDIUM — operators lose muscle memory.  
VALIDATION_REQUIRED: Every current tab remains reachable in one click from its group.  
STATUS: PARTIAL  

---

ACTION_ID: AUX-NO-HEALTH-AUDIT  
SOURCE_AUTOMATION: Admin UX & Information Architecture Auditor  
TITLE: Canister audit log has no owner view  
CATEGORY: health-audit  
PRIORITY: P1  
CONFIDENCE: HIGH  
EVIDENCE: `getAdminAuditLog` in `main.mo`; `_recordAdminAudit` on grant/ban/GameKey/config writes; frontend mock stub; AdminDashboard never calls it. Rollback writers exist.  
SYSTEMS_AFFECTED: Health tab (missing); `main.mo` audit log  
RECOMMENDED_ACTION: Read-only Audit tab: timestamp, actor, action, before/after. Link rollbacks with confirm. Do not invent a second log.  
AUTONOMY: HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED  
DEPENDENCIES: None  
REGRESSION_RISK: LOW for read-only; MEDIUM if rollback is one-click.  
VALIDATION_REQUIRED: Grant Doka appears in the log; non-admin cannot query.  
STATUS: NEW

TITLE: Spell editor is one ~1k-line live publish form  
CATEGORY: edit-forms

SOURCE_AUTOMATION: Admin UX & Information Architecture Auditor  
TITLE: No relationship pane for spell / enemy / asset  
CATEGORY: dependency-ux  
PRIORITY: P2  
CONFIDENCE: HIGH  
EVIDENCE: Spell↔boss pools exist only as chips in an expanded boss. Enemy↔regions is a checkbox list. No enemy→encounters/dungeons, asset→usage, spell→achievements/challenges.  
SYSTEMS_AFFECTED: All content editors  
RECOMMENDED_ACTION: Read-only dependency rail + badges.  
AUTONOMY: HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED

RECOMMENDED_ACTION: Overview from `getAdminAuditLog` + live/draft counts.  
AUTONOMY: HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED  
DEPENDENCIES: AUX-NO-HEALTH-AUDIT  
REGRESSION_RISK: LOW  
VALIDATION_REQUIRED: Default landing is Overview; Enemies one click away.

AUTONOMY: HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED  
DEPENDENCIES: AUX-NAV-FLAT-15

STATUS: NEW

SOURCE_AUTOMATION: Admin UX & Information Architecture Auditor  
TITLE: Boss ability chips were unfiltered

TITLE: No visual pool / weights / activate / revert control  
CATEGORY: visual-asset-ux  
PRIORITY: P2  
CONFIDENCE: HIGH  
EVIDENCE: Single optional URL. Default vs custom copy exists. No pool, weights, activate/deactivate, or first-class revert. Empty remains a valid default.  
SYSTEMS_AFFECTED: Enemy + sprite editors; Visuals tab (palette only)  
RECOMMENDED_ACTION: Weighted variants + revert-to-default without treating empty as error.  
AUTONOMY: HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED

SOURCE_AUTOMATION: Admin UX & Information Architecture Auditor  
TITLE: Missing owner domains must not become empty tabs  
CATEGORY: information-architecture  
PRIORITY: P2  
CONFIDENCE: HIGH  
EVIDENCE: Challenges hardcoded. AI/formations/encounters/dungeons/discovery/simulation/telemetry have no admin API. Shop packages are retired on the player path. Audit log *does* have an API.  
SYSTEMS_AFFECTED: Future tabs  
RECOMMENDED_ACTION: Do not add empty Challenges/AI/Formations/Dungeons/Telemetry tabs. Prefer Audit.  
AUTONOMY: REPORT_ONLY  
DEPENDENCIES: None

EVIDENCE: No read-only runner. Must not write wallets or killCount.  
SYSTEMS_AFFECTED: Future sim panel  
RECOMMENDED_ACTION: Report-only until a runner exists that cannot call `applyRewards` / `adminAddDokaToUser`.

SOURCE_AUTOMATION: Admin UX & Information Architecture Auditor  
TITLE: No ops metrics in the owner tool  
CATEGORY: telemetry  
PRIORITY: P2  
CONFIDENCE: HIGH

AUTONOMY: REPORT_ONLY  
DEPENDENCIES: AUX-NO-HEALTH-AUDIT  
REGRESSION_RISK: LOW

TITLE: Ground Doka + leader boost sit on Map Modifiers  
CATEGORY: information-architecture

DEPENDENCIES: AUX-NAV-FLAT-15

SOURCE_AUTOMATION: Admin UX & Information Architecture Auditor  
TITLE: Three save languages  
CATEGORY: save-feedback

CONFIDENCE: HIGH  
EVIDENCE: `toast`, hex `saveStatus` pill, “Saved!”, “Live save committed”, localStorage-only.

TITLE: Viewport guard is player-oriented  
CATEGORY: responsive  
PRIORITY: P3  
CONFIDENCE: HIGH  
EVIDENCE: `App.tsx` small-screen guard is bypassable but console `×` targets stay <44px. Owner-on-laptop-narrow is not a first-class layout.  
SYSTEMS_AFFECTED: App.tsx; delete buttons  
RECOMMENDED_ACTION: Do not ship a phone-first admin. Keep desktop density; enlarge destructive targets only.  
AUTONOMY: REPORT_ONLY

TITLE: Owner-tool `C` tokens are raw hex  
CATEGORY: visual-identity
