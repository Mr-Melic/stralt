/**
 * Pure turn-queue maintenance helpers.
 *
 * Centralizes the "a combatant left the queue" bookkeeping that previously
 * leaked out of sync between `setTurnOrder` (React state) and the parallel
 * refs (`turnOrderRef`, `currentTurnIndexRef`) that the turn-advance logic
 * at WorldExploration.tsx line 10436-10448 reads synchronously.
 *
 * The advance rule (WX line 10447) is:
 *   nextIdx = (prevIdx + 1) % prevOrder.length
 * so `currentTurnIndexRef.current` points at the combatant whose turn it
 * currently IS. When a combatant is removed:
 *   - removed index < current  -> shift current down by 1 (same combatant stays active)
 *   - removed index == current -> the removed combatant WAS the active turn.
 *     Do NOT advance implicitly: point currentIdx at the entry that PRECEDED
 *     the dead slot in the new (shorter) array, so the normal advanceTurn
 *     `(prevIdx + 1) % length` handoff lands on the combatant that shifted
 *     into the dead slot (the next entry in the original order). This keeps
 *     the wheel from shifting forward on its own; only advanceTurn moves it.
 *   - removed index >  current  -> no adjustment needed.
 *
 * This module is React-free and DOM-free at runtime. It imports only the
 * CombatantEntry TYPE (erased at compile time), matching the engine's
 * React-free runtime convention.

/**
 * Remove a combatant from the turn queue and keep all parallel state in sync.
 *
 * Filters `deadId` out of the turn-order array, syncs `turnOrderRef.current`
 * to the new array, adjusts `currentTurnIndexRef.current` based on where the
 * removed entry sat relative to the active turn, and calls `setTurnOrder`
 * with the new array.
 *
 * Index adjustment rules (applied after filtering out the dead entry):
 *   - removedIdx <  currentIdx -> decrement currentIdx by 1 (the same
 *     combatant stays active; everything after the gap shifts down).
 *   - removedIdx === currentIdx -> the removed combatant WAS the active
 *     turn (e.g. a summon expiring during its own turn). Do NOT advance
 *     implicitly: set currentIdx to the entry that PRECEDED the dead slot
 *     in the new array — `(removedIdx - 1 + newOrder.length) %
 *     newOrder.length` — so the normal advanceTurn `(prevIdx + 1) % length`
 *     handoff lands on the combatant that shifted into the dead slot (the
 *     next entry in the original order). The wheel does not move forward
 *     here; only advanceTurn advances it.
 *   - removedIdx >  currentIdx -> leave currentIdx unchanged (the active
 *     combatant is unaffected; only later entries moved).
 *
 * Edge cases: when `newOrder` is empty the index is forced to 0. When the
 * preserved position would land past the end of the shorter array it is
 * wrapped with modulo so it stays in range.
 *
 * Pure with respect to external state: it only mutates the two refs it is
 * handed and invokes the one setter it is handed. No other side effects.
