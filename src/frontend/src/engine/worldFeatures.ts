/**
 * engine/worldFeatures.ts — World Dynamics catalog (data + pure rolls).
 *
 * Design-only contract for tile, encounter, and event features that keep
 * generating decisions across indefinite progression. Uses rarity weights and
 * relative difficulty versus same-tier content — never player-level cutoffs.
 * Wave 1: WDD-2026-08-31-001. Wave 2: WDD-2026-09-01-001.
 *
 * This module does NOT generate maps, advance turns, or change combat damage
 * formulas. Placement must run after `evaluateSolvability` / finalize and
 * re-check reachability. Credits stay on `applyRewards`. Hazard HP stays on
 * `recordChallengeDamageTaken` / `recordInBattleChallengeDamage`.
 *
 * Existing systems this catalog does not replace:
 *  - Hazard tiles: lava / ice / spikes (`HazardTileType`)
 *  - 22 map modifiers in `mapModifiers.ts`
 *  - Portals + run filter in `portalRules.ts`
 *  - Ground Doka pickups
